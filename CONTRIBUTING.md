# Contributing to RVX

You can contribute to RVX in two ways:

- **Opening a new issue**

  Open a [new issue] whenever you want to report a bug, an issue in the [docs] or request a change or new feature.

- **Making a pull request**

  Help improve RVX by opening a pull request. All contributions are welcome!

  Here's a few tips for a good pull request:

    - Make small commits and give them a descriptive message. Avoid making a big commit that changes a lot of files.

      Sometimes changing a lot of files is unavoidable. If so, make sure that all the changes are related.
    
    - Send one pull request for each improvement, new feature or bug fix.

    - Make sure your code conforms to [RVX Coding Standards](CODING_STANDARDS.md).
 
    - Include test coverage.
 
    - Don't forget to add documentation!
